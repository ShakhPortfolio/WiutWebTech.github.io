Main page, as its name suggests, is the page through which paths to all other pages are accessed. 
In the beginning of that page(landing page), there is a button that directs to ALL COURSES page which contains all the courses that are offered by our webpage. Scrolling down for a bit, you can see some of the courses. Here user can choose desired course and clicks onto course name to get to new page called "course info" where full info about the course is given.
Coming to the middle, there is a beautiful section with a fixed background image. Here, a button(discover your courses) leads you to the "all courses" page.
After that section, there are given some info about instructors and their social accounts. Here, by clicking onto the instructor name you can access to instructor’s info page where you can get to know your instructor well.
Approaching to the end of the page, you can see blogs and news section where the latest news and activities are dropped. To read more about the news you are interested, just click onto "read more" button on the bottom or click to the news theme.
At the end, a footer with a beautiful background is located, here you can access to all the other pages.
Footer is separated into 4 parts. First part includes the links to the other pages of the website and second page includes other blogs section, third part contains some link to useful infos and the last one shows the best contact info to reach out the Edu-center. 
Web page is fully responsive meaning that regardless of the screen size, you can see its design and use its functions properly. To make the responsiveness even better, I used DISPLAY FLEX and DISPLAY GRID function because it can properly flex or grid the section where appropriate. In addition, text sizes are modified when you access the page though your phone.
